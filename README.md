## Preface

Currently, it's been almost a year since the 2024 Fall recruitment season started. During this time last year, many graduate students were nearing the end of their two-and-a-half-year master's program. For many, not only were they busy preparing for their graduation thesis, but they were also anxiously looking for jobs. My own campus recruitment process started at that time and lasted until April of the following year. It was a journey full of emotional ups and downs—from initial nervousness, to self-doubt in the middle, and finally confusion when making job decisions. After everything settled, there were so many thoughts I wanted to share. With the end of my student life approaching, I wanted to leave something behind at Fudan. Therefore, in April this year, I had the spontaneous idea of creating this handbook. After the collective efforts of many, we now have a preliminary version.

This handbook is intended to help our juniors and give them some guidance and comfort in the process of their job search.

## Handbook Structure

This handbook currently consists of four chapters:  

- Chapter 1: Available Resources at Fudan and Campus Recruitment Preparation  
- Chapter 2: Editor's Experience Sharing on Fall and Spring Recruitment  
- Chapter 3: Career and Job Selection Guide  
- Chapter 4: Interviews with Seniors

The current version contains 18 experience sharing articles and 19 interviews, with most of the content focused on Chapter 2 and Chapter 4. This is the Beta version, as some content still needs to be filled in, especially the Career Guide in Chapter 3. This section involves insights and analyses of different industries, and as the editors are recent graduates, we are unable to provide in-depth views solely based on personal experiences. We will be gathering more interview information to complete this section. We hope for your understanding and patience.

The reason for releasing the Beta version now is to allow the juniors to benefit from the available content before the recruitment season ends. We hope this can provide additional information for reference. At the same time, we hope that through the circulation of this handbook, we can connect with more alumni and industry seniors who are willing to share their experiences. If you happen to come across this handbook and are willing to participate in an interview or assist with editing, please contact me at <21210240339@m.fudan.edu.cn> or leave a message through the WeChat public account "破蛋计划Beta".

## Closing Remarks

Finally, I hope this handbook can not only provide practical help in terms of information but also encourage juniors who might face setbacks in their campus recruitment journey. After working for some time, I realized that no matter how well we prepare or how much information we gather, the final outcome largely depends on fate. Without experiencing a job firsthand, it's hard to understand its impact and significance to oneself. So, even if the outcome of campus recruitment isn't as expected, it's not the end. In this uncertain world, it's hard to say that it won't eventually turn into a blessing in disguise.

As one senior said during the interview: "Life is a marathon." In the long run, campus recruitment is just another small hill on the road of life, and there is more than one correct path ahead of us. As someone who has been through it, we all have faced the same struggles and emotional ups and downs. Looking back at this journey, I really want to tell the juniors who are struggling: "Keep going, don't worry. Although the process might be painful, you will eventually overcome the hill!"
